==========

The source files corresponding to my [blog](http://www.highsineburgh.com) series experimenting
with [SaltStack](http://www.saltstack.com/).

Tags have been added corresponding to the state of progress at the time a blog post was 
completed. To checkout the code at the time of that blog post clone the repository, find the 
latest tag corresponding to the part of the series (i.e for part 1 tags would be pt1, pt1.1, etc):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/highsineburgh/learn_salt.git

git tag -l 

git checkout tags/<tag_name>
```
